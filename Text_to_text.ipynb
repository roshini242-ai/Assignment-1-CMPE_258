            "### 1. **Types of Missiles**\n",
            "   - **Ballistic Missiles**: These follow a ballistic trajectory and are powered by rockets. They can be short-, medium-, or long-range. Examples include intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs).\n",
            "   - **Cruise Missiles**: These are powered by jet engines and fly at low altitudes, often using terrain-following radar to avoid detection. They can be launched from aircraft, ships, or ground platforms.\n",
            "   - **Anti-Ballistic Missiles (ABMs)**: These are designed to intercept and destroy incoming ballistic missiles.\n",
            "   - **Surface-to-Air Missiles (SAMs)**: These are used to defend against aircraft and other aerial threats.\n",
            "   - **Air-to-Air Missiles**: Fired from aircraft to destroy other aircraft.\n",
            "   - **Anti-Ship Missiles**: Designed to attack ships at sea.\n",

            "Missiles use various guidance systems to find their targets:\n",
            "   - **Inertial Guidance**: Uses internal sensors to track movement and calculate position.\n",
            "   - **GPS Guidance**: Relies on satellite navigation systems for precision.\n",
            "   - **Infrared (Heat-Seeking)**: Tracks the heat emitted by targets, such as jet engines.\n",
            "   - **Radar Guidance**: Uses radar waves to locate and track targets.\n",
            "   - **Laser Guidance**: Guided by a laser beam projected onto the target.\n",
